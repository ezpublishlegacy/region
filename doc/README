REGION EXTENSION
================

When geo-detection is triggered
====================================
Geo-detection is triggered when a user requests the home page or a non-region-specific URL (e.g /verve).
The web server redirects the browser to /region/index/ which then takes the requested URL and interprets it.
TODO: include as autoload so Apache redirects not required.


How the geo-detection works
===========================

In order to serve up a siteaccess, the region extension must formulate a region via a country code and a language.

1. Country code
	- GET variable 'TESTIP' (IP address) or 'country' (2-char country code)
	- it will first try to find a preferred region by looking up the user's IP address in a MaxMind Geo-lite database
   (sucked into MySQL DB tables)
   
2. Language
   - GET variable 'lang' (containing 3-char language code)
   - Browser languages

   
It formulates the region in the following order:

1. Exact match of region (language + country code) in list of available regions ("LanguageSA" under "RegionalSettings" in site.ini)
2. First item in above list with a country match
3. First item in above list with a language match
4. First item in above list
